# PDFImportDataManager

This is a program made in Java and utilizing Tabula, JavaFX, and SQLite to parse PDF files generated by Quickbooks and extract data from them. This data is then stored in an SQLite database, and can be used to generate weekly state and federal withholding reports.

Things left to do:
* Finish switching to the new way of transferring entry data around in the program (using an actual object with getters and setters instead of a map object with specific key names) 
* Remove or comment out unused code and functions
* Add more tests for all aspects of the program
* Add configuration file support:
  * Allow the user to manually define regions to scan in the PDF
  * Allow the user to manually define where the data is output in the report
* Handle all portrait/landscape PDF file possibilities (like a portrait mode report squeezed into a landscape format) (Difficult)
* Add more functionality
